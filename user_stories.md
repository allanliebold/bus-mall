- As a focus tester, I want a clean and easy to understand web page, so that I can provide my opinion accurately.

- As a developer, I want to use an object constructor to create image objects, so that I can give them properties such as number of clicks and whether a product has been displayed already.

- As a focus tester, I want to see a variety of different products, so that I don't get bored of seeing the same thing over and over.

- As a market researcher, I want the app to keep track of how many times each product is shown, so that I can compare that to the number of clicks received.

- As a developer, I want to have a counter for total clicks, so that I can stop the user voting after a certain number of clicks and show the results.

- As a market researcher, I want the app to collect 25 votes before showing the results, so that I have a larger sample of information to work with.
