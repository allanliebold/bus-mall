## User Stories

- As a market researcher, I want to be able to track customer interests, so that I can better direct them to products they may want to purchase.

- As a focus tester, I want a clean and easy to understand web page, so that I can provide my opinion accurately.

- As a developer, I want to use an object constructor to create image objects, so that I can give them properties such as number of clicks and whether a product has been displayed already.
